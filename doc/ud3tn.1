ud3tn - leightweight DTN protocol implementation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
ud3tn [OPTION]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\[mc]D3TN (pronounced "Micro-Dee-Tee-En") is a free software
project intended to offer an implementation of Delay-tolerant Networking
protocols for POSIX operating systems (well, and for Linux) plus for the
ARM Cortex STM32F4 microcontroller series.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-a, \[en]aap-host HOST
HOST specifies the IP address or hostname to which the application agent
service should be bound
.TP
-p.\ \[en]aap-port PORT
PORT specifies the port number to which the application agent service
should be bound
.TP
-b, \[en]bp-version 6|7
provides the Bundle Protocol version (6 or 7) to be used when creating
new bundles
.TP
-c, \[en]cla CLA_OPTIONS
provides parameters to the available CLA subsystem according to the
syntax documented below
.TP
-e, \[en]eid EID
the EID which is used by the started ud3tn instance itself
.TP
-h, \[en]help
display this help and exit
.TP
-l, \[en]lifetime SECONDS
used lifetime of a bundle created via AAP q
.TP
-m, \[en]max-bundle-size BYTES
threshold used to determine if a bundle has to be fragmented
.TP
-s, \[en]aap-socket PATH
path to the UNIX domain socket of the application agent service
.TP
-r, \[en]status-reports
enable status reporting
.TP
-u, \[en]usage
print usage summary and exit
.PP
\[mc]d3tn supports four different Convergence Layer Adapters (CLA): tcpclv3,
tcpspp, smtcp and mtcp.
Parameters are passed to these adapters via the CLA_OPTIONS leveraging
the -c option.
As all four adapters are TCP based, they may be configured providing a
host name or IP address and port number to which they should listen in
the case they are configured as passive.
Additionally, if tcpspp or smtcp are configured as active via their
third parameter, the provided host name or IP address and port number
are used for initiating a TCP connection.
.PP
To for example let tcpclv3 listen on 127.0.0.1 port 4000, the following
CLA_OPTIONS should be used:
.PP
\[lq]tcpclv3:127.0.0.1,4000\[rq]
.PP
To for example use tcpspp in passive mode listening on 127.0.0.1 port
5000, the following CLA_OPTIONS should be used:
.PP
\[lq]tcpspp:127.0.0.1,5000,false\[rq]
.PP
The following default CLA_OPTIONS are applied:
.PP
\[lq]tcpclv3:\f[I],4556;tcpspp:\f[R],4223,false,1;smtcp:\f[I],4222,false;mtcp:\f[R],4224\[rq]
