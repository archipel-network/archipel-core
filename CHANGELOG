Next Release (v0.13.0)
----------------------

- Preview version of AAP 2.0 - a new Protobuf-based application interface, with Python tooling equivalent to the AAP 1.0 tools provided in tools/aap2; see doc/aap20.md
- Added a "data decoder" that can be built using `make data-decoder` and allows for inspecting captured bundles and CLA packets as well as running fuzz testing on the parsers
- Support for local node IDs not containing a terminating slash (dtn scheme) or a service number (ipn scheme)
- Moved all compile-time configuration options to config.mk with examples and defaults documented in config.mk.example
- Introduce configurable log levels - you can now select how verbose the output should be and debug log messages are disabled at compile time for more performant release builds
- Improved rate limiting for outgoing CLA connections that now also works when operating over SSH tunnels
- Improved interoperability testing, including tests against HDTN and DTN7-rs
- Improved static analysis, including automated execution of cppcheck
- Added a Nix Flake definition and a Nix-based development environment
- Automated testing on macOS and FreeBSD
- Pinning of Python dependencies to ensure a deterministic Python environment
- Several small bug fixes, more tests, and general improvements

v0.12.0 "Loki"
--------------

- macOS support
- FreeBSD support
- ARM and ARM-64 support with Clang and GCC compilers
- improved interoperability testing with ION 3.7 and 4.1 plus IONe and added documentation for it
- substantial improvements of the test toolchain, including a Docker image with all dependencies, static analysis, and support for sanitizers
- aap_echo and aap_ping utilities plus a built-in echo agent to realize basic reachability and latency tests
- transparent delivery of the bundle creation timestamp to applications via the AAP bundle identifier
- CBHE (RFC 6260) support for incoming BPv6 bundles
- improved IPv6 support
- removal of the unused STM32 target
- lots of further bug fixes and improvements, internal simplifications, and cleanups

v0.11.0 "Kerwan"
----------------

- Implement Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation convergence layer (in this initial version without custody transfer features)
- Add proper support for the `ipn:` EID scheme (BPv7 and BPv6 without CBHE)
- Enable contacts with "infinite" capacity (long-running, high-data-rate contacts where the capacity does not matter anymore are considered to allow for infinite bundles)
- Add a simple bundle forwarding stress test
- Make the remote configuration capability a command line flag
- Fix build of `libud3tn.so` shared library
- Fix EID validation being too permissive
- Update license: µD3TN is now additionally provided under the Apache 2.0 license

v0.10.0 "Juliet"
----------------

- Disallow remote configuration: Config bundles are only accepted via AAP
- BPv7 compatibility:
    - Millisecond-based timestamps
    - Support of Bundle Age extension block
    - Drop previous node block (unsupported by µD3TN, but has to be removed according to standard)
- Add a Docker image
- Use working directory instead of `/tmp` for AAP socket by default
- Make it possible to use an RX read timeout for unreliable connections
- Increase maximum number of fragments
- Bugfixes and documentation improvements (e.g., README, quick start guide)

v0.9.0 "Imbrium"
----------------

The changes between µPCN v0.8.0 and this release include:

- GitLab publication and renaming to µD3TN

- Added support for BPv7 draft version 17 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis-17)
- IPv6 support for CLAs
- Removed neighbor discovery approach
- Support for a DTN application API based on an Application Agent Protocol (AAP)
- Major refactoring of build system
- New packet format of STM32 USB CLA made compatible with MTCP

µPCN v0.6.0 "Falsaron"
----------------------

In this release, an updated version of the Bundle Protocol version 7 draft specification (draft version 10) is available. Furthermore, the transmission and receive subsystem has been restructured to support various convergence layers.
